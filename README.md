# HOUSE_PRICE_PREDICTION
House price prediction is a project that involves developing a model or algorithm to estimate the selling price of residential 
properties. The goal is to create a reliable and accurate system that can predict the price of a house based on various features or
attributes associated with the property.

The project typically involves analyzing a dataset that contains information about previously sold houses, 
including factors such as location, size, number of bedrooms, amenities, proximity to facilities, and other relevant characteristics.
The dataset may also include historical sales prices.
